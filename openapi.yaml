    This is the MOTIS routing API.

    Overview of MOTIS API versions:

    MOTIS 0.x - deprecated/discontinued

    MOTIS 2.x - current, providing:

    * /api/v5/{plan,trip,stoptimes,map/trips} renamed METRO mode to SUBURBAN, AREAL_LIFT to AERIAL_LIFT; since MOTIS 2.5.0
    * /api/v4/{plan,trip,stoptimes,map/trips} new displayName property, routeShortName only contains actual route short name from source; since MOTIS 2.2.0
    * /api/v3/plan with correct maxTransfers API parameter (transfers actually corresponding to number of changes between transit legs (and not to number of transit legs), i.e. maxTransfers=0 returns direct public transit connections, as expected); since MOTIS 2.0.84 
    * /api/v2/{plan,trip} returns Google polylines with precision=6; since MOTIS 2.0.60
    * /api/v1/{plan,trip} returns Google polylines with precision=7 (not defined for |longitude|>107)
    * /api/v1/* all other endpoints

    If you use the JS client lib https://www.npmjs.com/package/@motis-project/motis-client, endpoint versions will be taken into account automatically (i.e. the newest one available will be used).

            For each `via` stop a minimum stay duration in minutes.
            
            The value `0` signals that it's allowed to stay in the same trip.
            This enables via stays without counting a transfer and can lead 
            to better connections with less transfers. Transfer connections can
            still be found with `viaMinimumStay=0`.

          description: |
            The maximum number of allowed transfers (i.e. interchanges between transit legs,
            pre- and postTransit do not count as transfers).
            `maxTransfers=0` searches for direct transit connections without any transfers.
            If you want to search only for non-transit connections (`FOOT`, `CAR`, etc.),
            send an empty `transitModes` parameter instead.

            If not provided, the routing uses the server-side default value
            which is hardcoded and very high to cover all use cases.
            
            *Warning*: Use with care. Setting this too low can lead to
            optimal (e.g. the fastest) journeys not being found.
            If this value is too low to reach the destination at all,
            it can lead to slow routing performance.

            In plan endpoints before v3, the behavior is off by one,
            i.e. `maxTransfers=0` only returns non-transit connections.

          in: query

          description: |
            The maximum travel time in minutes.
            If not provided, the routing to uses the value
            hardcoded in the server which is usually quite high.
            
            *Warning*: Use with care. Setting this too low can lead to
            optimal (e.g. the least transfers) journeys not being found.
            If this value is too low to reach the destination at all,
            it can lead to slow routing performance.

            Values smaller than 1.0 are not supported.

          required: false
          description: |
            Optional. Default is 25 meters.

          in: query
          required: false
          description: |
            Optional. Default is `FOOT`.
            
            Accessibility profile to use for pedestrian routing in transfers
            between transit connections, on the first mile, and last mile.
          schema:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/PedestrianProfile'
            default: FOOT

        - name: pedestrianSpeed
          in: query
          required: false
          description: |
            Optional

            Average speed for pedestrian routing.
          schema:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/PedestrianSpeed'

        - name: cyclingSpeed
          in: query
          required: false
          description: |
            Optional

            Average speed for bike routing.
          schema:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/CyclingSpeed'

        - name: elevationCosts
          in: query
          required: false
          description: |
            Optional. Default is `NONE`.

            Set an elevation cost profile, to penalize routes with incline.
            - `NONE`: No additional costs for elevations. This is the default behavior
            - `LOW`: Add a low cost for increase in elevation and incline along the way. This will prefer routes with less ascent, if small detours are required.
            - `HIGH`: Add a high cost for increase in elevation and incline along the way. This will prefer routes with less ascent, if larger detours are required.

            As using an elevation costs profile will increase the travel duration,
            routing through steep terrain may exceed the maximal allowed duration,
            causing a location to appear unreachable.
            Increasing the maximum travel time for these segments may resolve this issue.

            The profile is used for direct routing, on the first mile, and last mile.

            Elevation cost profiles are currently used by following street modes:
            - `BIKE`
          schema:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ElevationCosts'
            default: NONE

          description: |
            Optional. Default is `false`.
            
            Whether to use transfers routed on OpenStreetMap data.
          schema:
            type: boolean
            default: false

        - name: detailedTransfers
          in: query
          required: true
          description: |
            - true: Compute transfer polylines and step instructions.
            - false: Only return basic information (start time, end time, duration) for transfers.
          schema:
            type: boolean
            default: true

        - name: joinInterlinedLegs
          in: query
          description: |
            Optional. Default is `true`.
            
            Controls if a journey section with stay-seated transfers is returned:
            - `joinInterlinedLegs=false`: as several legs (full information about all trip numbers, headsigns, etc.).
              Legs that do not require a transfer (stay-seated transfer) are marked with `interlineWithPreviousLeg=true`.
            - `joinInterlinedLegs=true` (default behavior): as only one joined leg containing all stops
          schema:
            type: boolean
            default: true

        - name: transitModes
          in: query
          required: false
          description: |
            Optional. Default is `TRANSIT` which allows all transit modes (no restriction).
            Allowed modes for the transit part. If empty, no transit connections will be computed.
            For example, this can be used to allow only `SUBURBAN,SUBWAY,TRAM`.
          schema:
            default:
              - TRANSIT
            type: array
            items:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Mode'
          explode: false

        - name: directModes
          in: query
          required: false
          description: |
            Optional. Default is `WALK` which will compute walking routes as direct connections.
            
            Modes used for direction connections from start to destination without using transit.
            Results will be returned on the `direct` key.
            
            Note: Direct connections will only be returned on the first call. For paging calls, they can be omitted.
            
            Note: Transit connections that are slower than the fastest direct connection will not show up.
            This is being used as a cut-off during transit routing to speed up the search.
            To prevent this, it's possible to send two separate requests (one with only `transitModes` and one with only `directModes`).

            Note: the output `direct` array will stay empty if the input param `maxDirectTime` makes any direct trip impossible.
            
            Only non-transit modes such as `WALK`, `BIKE`, `CAR`, `BIKE_SHARING`, etc. can be used.

            Set an elevation cost profile, to penalize routes with incline.
            - `NONE`: No additional costs for elevations. This is the default behavior
            - `LOW`: Add a low cost for increase in elevation and incline along the way. This will prefer routes with less ascent, if small detours are required.
            - `HIGH`: Add a high cost for increase in elevation and incline along the way. This will prefer routes with less ascent, if larger detours are required.

            As using an elevation costs profile will increase the travel duration,
            routing through steep terrain may exceed the maximal allowed duration,

            If not provided, the routing uses the server-side default value
            which is hardcoded and very high to cover all use cases.
            
            *Warning*: Use with care. Setting this too low can lead to
            optimal (e.g. the fastest) journeys not being found.
            If this value is too low to reach the destination at all,
            it can lead to slow routing performance.

            In plan endpoints before v3, the behavior is off by one,
            i.e. `maxTransfers=0` only returns non-transit connections.

    FareTransfer:
      type: object
      description: |
        The concept is derived from: https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#fare_transfer_rulestxt

        Terminology:
          - **Leg**: An itinerary leg as described by the `Leg` type of this API description.
          - **Effective Fare Leg**: Itinerary legs can be joined together to form one *effective fare leg*.
          - **Fare Transfer**: A fare transfer groups two or more effective fare legs.
          - **A** is the first *effective fare leg* of potentially multiple consecutive legs contained in a fare transfer
          - **B** is any *effective fare leg* following the first *effective fare leg* in this transfer
          - **AB** are all changes between *effective fare legs* contained in this transfer

        The fare transfer rule is used to derive the final set of products of the itinerary legs contained in this transfer:
          - A_AB means that any product from the first effective fare leg combined with the product attached to the transfer itself (AB) which can be empty (= free). Note that all subsequent effective fare leg products need to be ignored in this case.
          - A_AB_B mean that a product for each effective fare leg needs to be purchased in a addition to the product attached to the transfer itself (AB) which can be empty (= free)
          - AB only the transfer product itself has to be purchased. Note that all fare products attached to the contained effective fare legs need to be ignored in this case.

        An itinerary `Leg` references the index of the fare transfer and the index of the effective fare leg in this transfer it belongs to.

            This is an `array<array<FareProduct>>` where the inner array
            lists all possible fare products that would cover this effective fare leg.
            Each "effective fare leg" can have multiple options for adult/child/weekly/monthly/day/one-way tickets etc.

        elevationCosts:
          description: |
            Optional. Default is `NONE`.

            Set an elevation cost profile, to penalize routes with incline.
            - `NONE`: No additional costs for elevations. This is the default behavior
            - `LOW`: Add a low cost for increase in elevation and incline along the way. This will prefer routes with less ascent, if small detours are required.
            - `HIGH`: Add a high cost for increase in elevation and incline along the way. This will prefer routes with less ascent, if larger detours are required.

            As using an elevation costs profile will increase the travel duration,
            routing through steep terrain may exceed the maximal allowed duration,
            causing a location to appear unreachable.
            Increasing the maximum travel time for these segments may resolve this issue.

            Elevation cost profiles are currently used by following street modes:
            - `BIKE`
