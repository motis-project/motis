        # Street modes
        
          - `WALK`: Walking some or all of the way of the route.
          - `BIKE`: Cycling for the entirety of the route or taking a bicycle onto the public transport (if enabled) and cycling from the arrival station to the destination.
          - `BIKE_RENTAL`: Taking a rented, shared-mobility bike for part or the entirety of the route.
          - `BIKE_TO_PARK`: Leaving the bicycle at the departure station and walking from the arrival station to the destination. This mode needs to be combined with at least one transit mode otherwise it behaves like an ordinary bicycle journey.
          - `CAR`: Driving your own car the entirety of the route. This can be combined with transit, where will return routes with a Kiss & Ride component. This means that the car is not parked in a permanent parking area but rather the passenger is dropped off (for example, at an airport) and the driver continues driving the car away from the drop off location.
          - `CAR_PARK` | `CAR_TO_PARK`: Driving a car to the park-and-ride facilities near a station and taking publictransport. This mode needs to be combined with at least one transit mode otherwise, it behaves like an ordinary car journey.
          - `CAR_HAILING`: Using a car hailing app like Uber or Lyft to get to a train station or all the way to the destination.
          - `CAR_PICKUP`: Walking to a pickup point along the road, driving to a drop-off point along the road, and walking the rest of the way. This can include various taxi-services or kiss & ride.
          - `CAR_RENTAL`: Walk to a car rental point, drive to a car rental drop-off point and walk the rest of the way. This can include car rental at fixed locations or free-floating services.
          - `FLEXIBLE`: Encompasses all types of on-demand and flexible transportation for example GTFS Flex or NeTEx Flexible Stop Places.
          - `SCOOTER_RENTAL`: Walking to a scooter rental point, riding a scooter to a scooter rental drop-off point, and walking the rest of the way. This can include scooter rental at fixed locations or free-floating services.
