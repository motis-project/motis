            If not provided, the routing uses the server-side default value
            which is hardcoded and very high to cover all use cases.

            optimal (e.g. the fastest) journeys not being found.
            If this value is too low to reach the destination at all,
            it can lead to slow routing performance.

      description: |
        The concept is derived from: https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#fare_transfer_rulestxt

        Terminology:
          - **Leg**: An itinerary leg as described by the `Leg` type of this API description.
          - **Effective Fare Leg**: Itinerary legs can be joined together to form one *effective fare leg*.
          - **Fare Transfer**: A fare transfer groups two or more effective fare legs.
          - **A** is the first *effective fare leg* of potentially multiple consecutive legs contained in a fare transfer
          - **B** is any *effective fare leg* following the first *effective fare leg* in this transfer
          - **AB** are all changes between *effective fare legs* contained in this transfer

        The fare transfer rule is used to derive the final set of products of the itinerary legs contained in this transfer:
          - A_AB means that any product from the first effective fare leg combined with the product attached to the transfer itself (AB) which can be empty (= free). Note that all subsequent effective fare leg products need to be ignored in this case.
          - A_AB_B mean that a product for each effective fare leg needs to be purchased in a addition to the product attached to the transfer itself (AB) which can be empty (= free)
          - AB only the transfer product itself has to be purchased. Note that all fare products attached to the contained effective fare legs need to be ignored in this case.

        An itinerary `Leg` references the index of the fare transfer and the index of the effective fare leg in this transfer it belongs to.
