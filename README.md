MOTIS stands for **M**ulti **O**bjective **T**ravel **I**nformation **S**ystem.

The core features are:

  - **Intermodal Routing**: computing optimal journeys mixing public transit, sharing mobility, walking, etc. in sensible ways. [Read more.](https://motis-project.de/docs/features/routing.html)
  - **Real Time Support**: considering delays, train cancellations, additional services, reroutings, track changes, etc. [Read more.](https://motis-project.de/docs/features/realtime.html#real-time-support)
  - **Visualization**: view vehicle movements in real-time. [Try it out!](https://demo.motis-project.de/public/)
  - **JSON API**: the backend provides a JSON API via HTTP. [Documentation](https://motis-project.de/docs/api/)
  
More detailed information can be found at [motis-project.de](https://motis-project.de).

To demonstrate the functionalities, an [Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.motis_project.demo) and a [web-based information system](https://demo.motis-project.de/) is available. The source code for both front-ends is available as Open Source Software [as well](https://github.com/motis-project/motis/tree/master/scripts).

The system can consume schedule timetables in the [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) or [HAFAS](https://www.fahrplanfelder.ch/fileadmin/fap_daten_test/hrdf.pdf) format as well as real time information in the [GTFS-RT](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/reference) (and RISML, a propriatary format at Deutsche Bahn) as input data. For pedestrian routing (handled by [Per Pedes Routing](https://github.com/motis-project/ppr)) and car routing (handled by [OSRM](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend)) OpenStreetMap data is used.
