> [!NOTE]  
> Due to developer capacity constraints we cannot support newer or older compilers.
> We also cannot support other versions of dependencies.
> In case of doubt you can check the full release build setup used in our CI [here](https://github.com/motis-project/docker-cpp-build/blob/master/Dockerfile).
> To exactly reproduce the CI build, you need to use the according preset from our [CMakePresets.json](../CMakePresets.json).

Requirements:

- A recent C++ compiler: Either [Clang](https://llvm.org/) 18 or GCC 13
- CMake 3.17 (or newer): [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/) ([Ubuntu APT Repository](https://apt.kitware.com/))
- Ninja: [ninja-build.org](https://ninja-build.org/)
- Git

> [!CAUTION]
> Unix Makefiles are not working. Please use Ninja to build.

> [!CAUTION]
> Motis' dependency management `pkg` requires that the project is cloned via SSH using an SSH key without a passphrase.
