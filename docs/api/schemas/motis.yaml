TimestampReason:
  description: |
    The information source for the real-time timestamp. The system is
    conservative in the sense that it selects the maximum timestamp from
    propagation, forecast or schedule time if there is no `IS` or `REPAIR`
    timestamp given.

    - `SCHEDULE`: the real-time timestamp is the schedule time. No real-time
      information.
    - `REPAIR`: there are conflicting real-time information and this
      timestamp needed to be repaired such that basic properties of the
      timetable hold (i.e. timestamps need to correspond to the event
      order).
    - `IS`: the system received a real-time message that the event took
      place with this timestamp.
    - `PROPAGATION`: the timestamp was computed by propagating times (e.g.
      from earlier stops of the stop sequence of a trip)
    - `FORECAST`: the system received a message that forecasted the event
      time.

    valid:
      description: |
        If this flag is `false`, the event is invalid. This is the case for the
        arrival event at the first stop and the departure event at the last
        stop.

Stop:
  description: |
    The stops are the basic building block of the journey data structure.
    Everything else references stops by their index.

    Note that there are four cases for `exit` and `enter`: when entering the
    first train, only `enter` is set. When exiting the last train, only `exit`
    is set. There may be walk segments before the first `enter` and after the
    last `exit`. For a direct interchange between two trains, `enter` *and*
    `exit` are set. For a walk between two stops, `exit` is set at the first
    stop and `enter` is set at the second stop. There may be more than one walk
    segments in between. For every stop where the train just stops, neither
    `enter` nor `exit` is set.

Connection:
  description: |
    A connection is a journey from a coordinate/station to another
    coordinate/station. The core of the journey is the stop sequence. Other
    information (such as `transports` and `trips`) reference stops by their
    index in the stop sequence.
  fields:
    stops:
      description: |
        The stop sequence including (real-time) event times and information
        about alighting and entering of services. This is the core of the
        journey. All other collections in the `Connection` reference stop
        indices.
    transports:
      description: |
        Information about the transports that are used with their corresponding
        stop range.
    trips:
      description: |
        Trip IDs for each trip that is used in the journey with their
        corresponding stop range.
    attributes:
      description: |
        Attributes that are active within the corresponding stop range.
    free_texts:
      description: |
        Free text messages can be used by the operator to inform and guide
        users.
    problems:
      description: |
        Problems with the journey. This is empty for fresh journeys but can be
        populated when real-time information such as cancellations, etc. are
        processed.
