TripLoadRecommendationMeasure:
  description: |
    Simulate an announcement that a trip is overcrowded and recommend
    alternative trips with load information.

    This simulates an announcement of the form:
    - Passengers travelling to `planned_destinations`
    - Trip(s) `full_trips` are overcrowded (can't be used)
    - Recommended alternatives: `recommended_trips`

    The announcement is made at `time` in the trips/at the stations
    specified in `recipients`.

      description: TODO
    time:
      description: >

RtUpdateMeasure:
  description: |
    Simulate a real-time update.

    Real-time updates can be provided in RIBasis or RISML formats.
    Set `type` to the format and supply the complete real-time update
    in the corresponding format as a string in the `content` field.

    Passengers whose journey breaks because of the real-time update
    are automatically rerouted and do not need to be specified via
    `recipients`. If additional passengers should be made aware of the
    update and be allowed to change their route (e.g. because an
    additional train was added), they can be listed in `recipients`,
    otherwise `recipients` can be empty for this measure type.
  fields:
    recipients:
      description: TODO
    time:
      description: |
        Time at which the measure takes effect (unix timestamp).

        This must match the creation/release time of the given real-time update
        (e.g. `meta.created` for RI Basis messages).

    measures:
      description: |
        A list of measures to simulate

        All measures have the following shared properties:

        - `time`: Time at which the measure takes effect and passengers are made
          aware of it. Note that the time is not forwarded to this point during the
          simulation, i.e. no real-time updates (other than those specified as rt
          update measures) are applied during the simulation. If a call to
          `/paxforecast/apply_measures` contains measures with different timestamps,
          a simulation is run for each unique timestamp. All measures with the same
          timestamp are applied in one step.
        - `recipients`: Select a subset of passengers that is made aware of the
          measure (e.g. using an announcement)
          - `trips`: Select passengers that are in one of the listed trips at `time`
          - `stations`: Select passengers that are at one of the listed stations at
            `time` (not in a trip)
    replace_existing:
      description: |
        If set to true, only simulate the measures given in this API call.
        If set to false, measures from previous calls are kept and merged with
        the new measures for this simulation.

        **Should always be set to true for now.**
      examples:
        - true
    preparation_time:
      description: |
        Preparation time for passengers in minutes. Passengers can only
        change trains after the preparation time.

        Should usually be set to 0.
    include_before_trip_load_info:
      description: |
        If set to true, `before_edges` in the response (in `PaxMonUpdatedTrip`)
        is set, otherwise it will be empty. It contains load information for
        all trip edges before any changes were made.

        Note that if the trip route is modified using real-time updates, this
        contains the state of the trip *before* any of those changes were
        applied.
    include_after_trip_load_info:
      description: |
        If set to true, `after_edges` in the response (in `PaxMonUpdatedTrip`)
        is set, otherwise it will be empty. It contains load information for
        all trip edges after all changes were made.

        Note that if the trip route is modified using real-time updates, this
        contains the state of the trip *after* any of those changes were
        applied.
    include_trips_with_unchanged_load:
      description: |
        If set to true, all trips that are modified are included in the
        response, even if there is no major change in the predicted number
        of passengers on any section.

        If set to false, trips with only minor changes are not included
        the response.

        Currently used criteria are changes in the number of critical sections
        or the maximum number of passengers.
