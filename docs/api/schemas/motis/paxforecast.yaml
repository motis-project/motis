    replace_existing:
      description: |
        If set to true, only simulate the measures given in this API call.
        If set to false, measures from previous calls are kept and merged with
        the new measures for this simulation.

        **Should always be set to true for now.**
      examples:
        - true
    preparation_time:
      description: |
        Preparation time for passengers in minutes. Passengers can only
        change trains after the preparation time.

        Should usually be set to 0.
    include_before_trip_load_info:
      description: |
        If set to true, `before_edges` in the response (in `PaxMonUpdatedTrip`)
        is set, otherwise it will be empty. It contains load information for
        all trip edges before any changes were made.

        Note that if the trip route is modified using real-time updates, this
        contains the state of the trip *before* any of those changes were
        applied.
    include_after_trip_load_info:
      description: |
        If set to true, `after_edges` in the response (in `PaxMonUpdatedTrip`)
        is set, otherwise it will be empty. It contains load information for
        all trip edges after all changes were made.

        Note that if the trip route is modified using real-time updates, this
        contains the state of the trip *after* any of those changes were
        applied.
    include_trips_with_unchanged_load:
      description: |
        If set to true, all trips that are modified are included in the
        response, even if there is no major change in the predicted number
        of passengers on any section.

        If set to false, trips with only minor changes are not included
        the response.

        Currently used criteria are changes in the number of critical sections
        or the maximum number of passengers.
