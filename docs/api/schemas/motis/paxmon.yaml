    - `DepartureOrArrivalTime`: The trip id departure or arrival (scheduled departure time at the
      first stop or scheduled arrival time at the last stop) must be in the filter interval
    - `ActiveTime`: The trip must be active in the filter interval according to the trip id
      (i.e. the scheduled departure time must be before the interval end and the scheduled
      arrival time at the last stop must be after the interval begin)

    universe:

        ID of the base universe. This is the universe that is copied. Specify 0
        to copy the main universe or a forked universe to create a fork of that
        universe. The base universe can be destroyed before universes forked
        from it are destroyed, i.e. forked universes don't depend on their base
        universe once forked (note that the main universe can't be destroyed).
    fork_schedule:
      description: |
        If set to true, the schedule is frozen and copied as well.

        This is required for the simulation of real-time updates or if MOTIS
        is run in live mode where real-time updates may be applied before the
        universe is destroyed.
        If set to false, reuse the schedule of the base universe.

        Normally, this should always be set to true.
    ttl:
      description: |
        Time to live of the new universe, in seconds.

        The universe is automatically destroyed when it is not accessed for at
        least ttl seconds. Each universe access (including keep alive requests)
        resets the remaining time to live.

        If set to 0 the universe never expires and must be destroyed manually.

        The server limits the allowed range of the ttl value based on its
        configuration. There is an upper limit and unlimited universes
        (ttl = 0) may be disabled. The actual time to live for the newly
        created universe is returned in the API response.
  examples:
    - universe: 0
      fork_schedule: true
      ttl: 120

        Whether to count passengers or passenger groups in the result.

        See the documentation for the response for more information about
        fields affected by this setting.

        If set to true, passengers are counted (e.g. a passenger group with
        3 passengers counts as 3), otherwise groups are counted (e.g. a
        passenger group with 3 passengers counts as 1).
PaxMonHistogram:
  description: |
    A histogram plus some additional metrics such as average and median value.

    The histogram data is contained in the `counts` field. The first entry
    gives the count of `min_value`, the second entry gives the count of
    `min_value + 1` and so on until the last entry, which gives the count
    of `max_value`. The bin size is always 1.

    Note that both `min_value` and `max_value` can be < 0 depending on the
    underlying data (e.g. for delays).
  fields:
    min_value:
      description: Value of the first entry in `counts`.
    max_value:
      description: Value of the last entry in `counts`.
    avg_value:

    total_count:

        Delays are in minutes.

        Routes that don't reach the planned destination are ignored.

        Depending on the value of the `count_passengers` flag in the
        request, the histogram contains either passengers or passenger groups.
    max_estimated_delay:
      description: |
        The highest possible estimated delays for all passenger groups or
        passengers in the universe, i.e. the delay of the route with the
        latest arrival time for each passenger group.

        Delays are in minutes.

        Routes that don't reach the planned destination are ignored.

        Depending on the value of the `count_passengers` flag in the
        request, the histogram contains either passengers or passenger groups.
    expected_estimated_delay:
      description: |
        The expected delays for all passenger groups or
        passengers in the universe, i.e. the weighted (by route probability)
        average of the delays of all routes for each passenger group.

        Delays are in minutes.

        Routes that don't reach the planned destination are ignored.

        Depending on the value of the `count_passengers` flag in the

    Note the following peculiarities:
    - For both the `start` and `destination` fields, only the `id` is
      guaranteed to be set. Name and position are only set if the station
      was found in the schedule.
    - For the `primary_trip_id`, only the primary identifiers (`station_id`,
      `train_nr` and `time`) are set. The other values must be ignored.

      of the latest real-time message that was processed)
    - `by_processing_time`: Grouped by the time a message was processed
