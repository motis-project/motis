        If set to 0 the universe never expires and must be destroyed manually.

        The server limits the allowed range of the ttl value based on its
        configuration. There is an upper limit and unlimited universes
        (ttl = 0) may be disabled. The actual time to live for the newly
        created universe is returned in the API response.
  examples:
    - universe: 0
      fork_schedule: true
      ttl: 120

        Whether to count passengers or passenger groups in the result.

        See the documentation for the response for more information about
        fields affected by this setting.

        If set to true, passengers are counted (e.g. a passenger group with
        3 passengers counts as 3), otherwise groups are counted (e.g. a
        passenger group with 3 passengers counts as 1).
PaxMonHistogram:
  description: |
    A histogram plus some additional metrics such as average and median value.

    The histogram data is contained in the `counts` field. The first entry
    gives the count of `min_value`, the second entry gives the count of
    `min_value + 1` and so on until the last entry, which gives the count
    of `max_value`. The bin size is always 1.

    Note that both `min_value` and `max_value` can be < 0 depending on the
    underlying data (e.g. for delays).
  fields:
    min_value:
      description: Value of the first entry in `counts`.
    max_value:
      description: Value of the last entry in `counts`.
    avg_value:
      description: The average value of the distribution.
    median_value:
      description: The median value of the distribution.
    max_count:
      description: The largest entry in `counts`.
    total_count:
      description: The sum of all entries in `counts`.

        Delays are in minutes.

        Routes that don't reach the planned destination are ignored.

        Depending on the value of the `count_passengers` flag in the
        request, the histogram contains either passengers or passenger groups.
    max_estimated_delay:
      description: |
        The highest possible estimated delays for all passenger groups or
        passengers in the universe, i.e. the delay of the route with the
        latest arrival time for each passenger group.

        Delays are in minutes.

        Routes that don't reach the planned destination are ignored.

        Depending on the value of the `count_passengers` flag in the
        request, the histogram contains either passengers or passenger groups.
    expected_estimated_delay:
      description: |
        The expected delays for all passenger groups or
        passengers in the universe, i.e. the weighted (by route probability)
        average of the delays of all routes for each passenger group.

        Delays are in minutes.

        Routes that don't reach the planned destination are ignored.

PaxMonVehicleGroupInfo:
  description: |
    Information about a vehicle group.

    Note the following peculiarities:
    - For both the `start` and `destination` fields, only the `id` is
      guaranteed to be set. Name and position are only set if the station
      was found in the schedule.
    - For the `primary_trip_id`, only the primary identifiers (`station_id`,
      `train_nr` and `time`) are set. The other values must be ignored.
